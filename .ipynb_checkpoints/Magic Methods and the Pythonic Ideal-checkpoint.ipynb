    "As expected, multiplication produces the same result as repeated addition. Your own objects can overload almost every operator in Python thanks to *magic methods*, special methods named with leading and trailing `__` (double underscores). For example, to support `+` you implement the `__add__` *magic method*. The expression `a * b` is executed as `a.__mul__(b)` – in the simplest case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those special methods are called *magic* because they implement behavior that requires supernatural powers in other languages, like supporting arithmetic operators, attribute acess, indexing, iteration etc. But in Python such behavior is not magic at all: any muggle like you and I can code classes in Python that behave as naturally as the built-in types written in C. Contrast this with Go or Java, where only some blessed native types support syntax like infix operators or indexing with `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Informally, many Pythonistas prefer to call the special methods *dunder methods* – where *dunder* is short for *double underscore*. So `__add__` is pronounced as \"dunder add\"."

    "The `requests` package from Kenneth Reitz is more Pythonic than the `urllib` module of the standard library. Its official documentation contrasts some usage examples from each library. Here is a Python 2 snippet from `urllib2` quoted by Reitz:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Python gives you full control of the `obj.attr` notation: you can handle access to missing attributes by implementing the `__getattr__` special method, while `__setattr__` allows you to control attribute assignment, e.g. `obj.attr = 42`. Properties and descriptors are more powerful mechanisms for attribute access control, but they are not covered in this presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` special methods allow your objects to support item access and assignment using numeric indices, arbitrary keys and even slice notation, e.g. `obj[start:stop:step]`.\n"
